      As a showcase piece in a prime tourist area, we designed a life-sized LEGO bus shelter. Every detail—from bench, to roof, to little birdy—was recreated in proportionally-sized LEGO bricks. The shelter embodied the idea of building the unbuildable and captured attention for blocks, pun intended.
